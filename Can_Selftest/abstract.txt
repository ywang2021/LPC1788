@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to test CAN self-test mode
	Process:
		Self test mode used in this example is local seft-test. It fits for single node tests.
		With the Self test mode, the transmitted message is also received and stored in the 
		receive buffer. Bypass mode is enabled, so this received is legal.
		After receive message, it will be compared with transmitted message. 
		If they are same, self-test mode is successful.
		If not, self-test mode is fail.
		Pls observe process via serial display.

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			LPC1788 OEM board rev A connects with OEM Base Board rev A
				+ Connect: TP6 - P0.4-RD2 (J5.16)
				+ Connect: TP8 - P0.5-TD2 (J5.15)
				+ JP14: 1-3: ON
						2-4: ON
			(Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
			
		Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- UART0: USB serial port
					+ All jumpers: Default
				- UART1: 
					+ P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
					+ P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2
				- UART2:
					+ JP6: 	1-2: OFF
							3-4: OFF
							5-6: ON
					+ JP12: 1-2
					+ JP13: 1-2
					+ Other jumpers: Default
				- UART3:
					+ P0.2 (@J5.13) - JP12.2
					+ P0.3 (@J5.14) - JP13.2
				- UART4:
					+ P0.22 (@J3.25) - JP12.2
					+ P2.9  (@J3.15) - JP13.2
	    	2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- UART0: 
					All jumpers: optional
			Note: Pls sure that "USED_UART_DEBUG_PORT" macro in debug_frmwrk.h is set correctly
			
			Setting:
				+ 115200bps 
				+ 8 data bit 
				+ No parity 
				+ 1 stop bit 
				+ No flow control 
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART0\1\2 on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example and observe on serial display
